# java_lox
This is my implementation of the Lox programming language described in https://craftinginterpreters.com. </br>

*The java code in this repo can be found in the jlox part of the book at https://craftinginterpreters.com.*

# stuff that I should do now that I have finished coding the interpreter
* make gists for the functions (and maybe classes, enums, etc.) that I haven't made gists for
* maybe add more features (hell no >:( I have already suffered enough by coding in Java)
* make a Kotlin version so I can suffer in Kotlin and not Java
